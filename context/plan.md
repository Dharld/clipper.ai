# 🎧 ClipForge — Smart Podcast Clip Generator

## Overview
ClipForge is a web app that helps podcasters turn long episodes into short, viral clips ready for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels.

A user uploads a full podcast video (or audio), and the app automatically detects interesting moments, cuts them into short clips, and lets the creator download or refine them.

## 🧠 Core Idea
**Goal:** Save creators time by finding and preparing their best podcast moments automatically.

**Input:**  
- A full podcast episode (30–60 minutes).  
- Optional description or title for context.

**Output:**  
- 5–10 short clips (15–60 seconds each).  
- Each clip includes timestamps, preview, and downloadable video.

## 🪜 Simple Flow
1. **Upload:** Creator uploads an episode (video or audio).  
2. **Transcription:** The app transcribes speech using an AI model.  
3. **Highlight Detection:** The system finds emotional, topic-changing, or high-energy moments.  
4. **Clip Suggestions:** User sees previews and can select or delete clips.  
5. **Export:** Selected clips are processed and made ready to download or post.

## 🚀 MVP Scope
For the first version, the app will:
- Accept podcast uploads (video or audio).  
- Generate 3–5 automatic clip suggestions.  
- Provide playback and trimming for each clip.  
- Allow downloads in standard format (MP4).  

No fancy captions, overlays, or layouts yet — just smart, automatic cuts.

## 🧩 Example Use Case

> The creator keeps three, adds captions later, and shares them as Reels within minutes.
